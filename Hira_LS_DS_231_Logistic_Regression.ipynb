        "- [Logistic regression from scratch in numpy](https://blog.goodaudience.com/logistic-regression-from-scratch-in-numpy-5841c09e425f) - if you want to dig in a bit more to both the code and math (also takes a gradient descent approach, introducing the logistic loss function)\n",
        "- Create a visualization to show predictions of your model - ideally show a confidence interval based on error!\n",
        "- Check out and compare classification models from scikit-learn, such as [SVM](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html#classification), [decision trees](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html#classification), and [naive Bayes](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/naive_bayes.html). The underlying math will vary significantly, but the API (how you write the code) and interpretation will actually be fairly similar.\n",
        "- Sign up for [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com), and find a competition to try logistic regression with\n",
        "- (Not logistic regression related) If you enjoyed the assignment, you may want to read up on [music informatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_informatics), which is how those audio features were actually calculated. The FMA includes the actual raw audio, so (while this is more of a longterm project than a stretch goal, and won't fit in Colab) if you'd like you can check those out and see what sort of deeper analysis you can do."
